CorpusDB2
=========

Second generation of CorpusDB --- corpus-based processing for Python, SuperCollider, and beyond.

CorpusDB2 will borrow heavily from [CorpusDB](http://github.com/kitefishlabs/CorpusDB) in its initial stages. The goal (see below) is to iterate rapidly on as much of an existing design as possible. 


Goals
-----

1. A robust set of tools for creative, data-driven MIR, corpus-based processing, and other creative applications.
2. Modular tools that can be remixed into applications and forked into other forms.
3. Sets of specifications for components that allow for the reuse of and cooperation between implementations.

CorpusDB2 is owned by all its authors and contributors. This is an open source project licensed under the GPLv3 (and possibly the LGPL). This is an experiment in growing a project using the C4.1 process. If you are interested in contributing, please read about the process and get in touch.
